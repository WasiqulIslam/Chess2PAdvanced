This program is jdk1.3 compatible only(not jdk1.5 or near).

If you have already installed java at 'C:\jdk1.3' directory you can:
Compile all files by just double clicking 'Compile.bat' file and then
Run program by double clicking 'Run.bat' file.( in windows systems ).
For playing the game with appropriate window size
your monitor should support at least 800 X 600 resolution and
set monitor resolution to 800 X 600 pixels before running the program.

No help is attached with this program. After running the program right clicking on the window
will bring a popup menu with which you can play. This program has no AI(artificial intelligence)
and made only to simulate a simple chess board. So the piece movement is not restricted.
But it has an enhanced saving functionality.
Try choosing different options from the popup menu to learn more in trial and error.

With this program you can play full chess game and overcome any chess situation such
 as castling
or pawn upgrading. You have to move twice for castling. On the other hand you have to use
'Change a piece of chess' option from the popup(right clicking brings the popup menu)
 menu to upgrade a pawn into queen
 or anything as you like. Upgradation of pawn means the changing of pawn into another
piece of chess when it reaches the other side of the board from its
 initial position(in enemy territory).
